# Real-World Evaluation of LLMs in Nutrition

We present the codebase used in our seven-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating large language model (LLM) features in a nutrition chatbot. The project assesses real-world impact on dietary outcomes, emotional well-being, and engagement.

## Experiment Summary

Our RCT (n=81) compared three versions of a nutrition chatbot:
1. **Baseline** – Rule-based chatbot only  
2. **Rephrased** – With LLM-powered rephrasing  
3. **Counselling** – With an added fine-tuned LLM for nutritional counselling

Despite strong performance in intrinsic evaluations, LLM-based interventions did not yield consistent real-world benefits, revealing a key gap between model fluency and outcome relevance.

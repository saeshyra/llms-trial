The following edits are necessary to guarantee the correct functioning of the bot:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) RASA max number of predictions
In rasa/core/processor.py replace:
MAX_NUMBER_OF_PREDICTIONS = int(os.environ.get("MAX_NUMBER_OF_PREDICTIONS", "10"))
with

#EDIT
MAX_NUMBER_OF_PREDICTIONS = int(os.environ.get("MAX_NUMBER_OF_PREDICTIONS", "100"))

This lets RASA predict a much higher number of actions upon user input. 100 is definitely overkill and used just as an
example in here. Not doing this will lead to "circuit breaker tripped" error.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Using Telegram Markdown
In rasa/core/channels/telegram.py under send_text_message method replace:

self.send_message(recipient_id, message_part)

with

#EDIT
self.send_message(recipient_id, message_part, parse_mode='Markdown')

This lets RASA use the traditional Telegram Markdown (e.g.: * for bold). Attempts to use MarkdownV2 were unsuccessful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Include metadata in tracker messages
In rasa/core/channels/channel.py implement the get_metadata method:

    #EDIT
    def get_metadata(self, request):
        request_dict = request.json
        return request_dict

This lets RASA access some further information that the chabot uses to handle certain interaction flows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Fix Telebot image handle
In telebot/__init__.py", add the following at the beginning of send_photo method:

        #EDIT
        try:
            with open(photo, 'rb') as f:
                photo = f.read()
        except:
            print('DEBUG: picture do not appear to be a file, reading as URL')


This will avoid handling pictures as URLS, a problem that recently arised in Telebot. The method doesn't compromise
sending pictures as URLS.
